Before installing NoelTexturesPy, you need to install *Docker*. Depending on your operating system (OS), the procedure might be slightly different.

!!! WARNING
    It is essential to use a recent version of your operating system. Docker used to have a version for older systems (Docker Toolbox), but it is no longer available, so no longer maintained or upgraded. If you cannot update the OS to its most recent version, your technical support with Docker will be limited.
